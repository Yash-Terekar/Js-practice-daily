# 🔥 JavaScript Practice Daily

Welcome to my JavaScript Practice Repository!  
This is my daily journey to master core JavaScript with real-world logic, problem solving, and mini projects. Each day is dedicated to specific concepts, tasks, and code exercises to build a strong foundation as a full-stack developer.

- ✅ Real-world logic building
- ✅ ES6+ syntax & patterns
- ✅ Mini projects & animations
- ✅ Problem-solving with arrays, objects, functions, OOP & async handling
- ✅ Organized day-wise progress tracking
